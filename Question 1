Question-https://leetcode.com/problems/monthly-transactions-i/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50
SELECT  SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count, SUM(amount) as trans_total_amount, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END) as approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country

Solution Explanation
Here the question asks us to print total transactions,approved transactions,amount and approved transaction amount for each month
1)We select Substring of trans_date that contains Year and month ('YYYY-MM') because thats what we need.
2)Then we select the country,and since we need total transaction count we take the id count.
3)Now for approved count we take the case when state='approved' and sum those transaction count,same for transaction amount
4)We finally group it by Month and Country
